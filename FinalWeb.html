            <p>70% of global CO2 emissions come from cities. That means if we can make cities more  sustainable, nearly 70% of CO2 admissions would be gone. With climate change getting worse, more people are protesting for sustainable cities and more people are making changes.</p>

            <p>There are some issues though, as the cities that pollute the most are also the <br>poorest, because they need cheap power. In order to fix this, we would need <br>richer governments to gift supplies for clean energy to the poorer countries.</p>

    <h3>Affordable and Clean Energy</h3>
    <p>There are two UN goals that cover this topic,the first goal is affordable and clean energy. It is number 7 and it wants everyone, wherever they are to have access to energy that is sustainable for the enviroment. 2.4 billion people still cook in a way that produces a lots of pollution. This is because they don't have a modern way to cook.</p>

        </div>
    <h3>Sustainable Cities and Communities</h3>
    <p>The other goal is 11, which focuses on making cities safe and sustainable for everyone. This means building disaster proof housing in distater-prone cities, improving the air in cities as 99% of city air is polluted and finally, giving cheap and sustainable power to people that need it.</p>

 </div>
    <h3>The Problem And How The Goals Interact</h3>
    <p>When you combine the to goals together, you get "sustainable power for cities". The 7th goal focuses on sustainable power and the 11th is  <br>sustainable cities, so the overlap makes sense. But why do why is it so important to get sustainable power forcities? Well the obvious answer is that it will decrease CO2 production as<br> mentioned before, but it also will cause better air quality in cities, <br> which cities in South Africa, China and India really struggle with.  </p>

    <h3>How YOU can help</h3>
    <p>Now you may be wondering: "How can I, a young student help with such a big problem?" Well there are lots of small things you can do. <br>There are three main ways to helps that will only take a small amount of time. The first is to turn lights off, if they are not being used, as this is great for saving power. Another way is to use fuel efficient travel,  like bikes which use no fuel, and public transit, which moves a lot people at the same time. The last way to help is harder, but more impactful. It is to add a solar panel to your house(make sure you have your parents help and permission). The solar panel will not only give your home more sustainable power, but it will also give power if there is an outage, which will keep your family extra safe.</p>
